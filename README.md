## Hello World

+ Hi! I'm Francisco and I'm taking Github's hello world guide;
+ In this account, I intend to add some demo projects from technologies that I use:
	+ Natural Language Processing;
	+ Machine Learning;
	+ Computer Vision.
+ I'm also an avid mineral collector. For that reason, don't be surprised if you find a lot of mineral-related projects here.
